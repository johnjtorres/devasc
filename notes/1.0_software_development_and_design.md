# 1.2 Describe parsing of common data format (XML, JSON, and YAML) to Python data structures

## **XML**

- `xml` built-in library can be used to parse XML in its native format.
- `xmltodict` module can be used to convert XML to a python dictionary.
  - `$ pip install xmltodict`
- [Example of xml parsing with python](./xml_parsing.py)

# 1.3 Describe the concepts of test-driven development

- The idea is to write a test that fails, and that write the code to make it pass.
- The opposite of this is writing the code first and then creating tests later.
- A unit test is a test for the smallest unit of code.
  - `pytest` and `unittest` python libraries can be used for this.

### Steps

1. Write a test case for a small unit of code.
2. Run the test. The result should be the test fails because no code has been written yet.
3. Write code to make the test pass at the most basic level.
4. Run the tests again. The tests now pass.
5. Refactor.

### Benefits

- Writing a test case is a way of translating the customer's requirements into code. By ensuring the test case fails, by ensuring the test passes, the developer can be assured that the client's requirements are being met.
- Limits WIP. Writing code to make one test pass means that the developer has to focus on small units of code at a time. This also encourages writing clean code as opposed to giant monolithic functions.
- When new features get added, the test suite can be ran to ensure other features aren't being broken.

# 1.4 Compare software development methods (agile, lean, and waterfall)

|               | Waterfall                                                                                                                | Lean                                                                                                                     | Agile                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Philosophy    | - Steps followed sequentially. <br/> - Analysis, Design, Develop, Test, Deploy <br/> - Popular in construction industry. | - Utilizes _kanban_ to limit WIP. <br/> - Born from Toyota Manufacturing process.                                        | - Focus on what can get done in a few weeks (**sprint**). <br/> - Various rituals and roles are involved (**scrum**). <br/> - Adaptation and a focus on customer/good software is paramount. |
| Advantages    | - Simple, intuitive.                                                                                                     | - Reduces waste by limiting WIP. <br/> - Fast delivery.                                                                  | - Customer's needs are prioritized. <br/> - Value is delivered on a regular basis (2 - 4 weeks). <br/> - Testing and lessons learned is built-in to the process.                             |
| Disadvantages | - Difficult to add new requirements. <br/> - Client only received value at the end. <br/> - Testing done at the end.     | - Only what is in WIP can be worked on. <br/> - Requires discipline. <br/> - May just lead to shipping bad stuff faster. | - Requires lots of collaboration. <br/> - Customer must be involved. <br/> - Thorough documentation is not prioritized.                                                                      |

# 1.5 Explain the benefits of organizing code into methods / functions, classes, and modules

- Code is read more than it is ran. Organizing code means that others who read your code will be able to debug it or otherwise contribute to it more easily.
- D.R.Y = Don't Repeat Yourself. A function can be written once and used many times.
- Easier to make changes later on. You don't have to make changes in multiple places where the same logic was written.
- Easier to debug. If an error occurs in a function, the scope of the problem can be limited to just those lines of code.
- Easier to test. Test cases are more easily derived for smaller units of code.
- Reduces indentation. Indentation can be a sign of high complexity.

### Methods/functions

- Should be written to accomplish one task. Avoid side effects.
- The name should make it clear what it does even without comments.

### Classes

- Create a class when many variables and functions are related.
- Class name should be a noun.

### Modules

- A module is a python file. Closely related functions and classes should be placed in modules.
- Can be imported into other python modules for reuse.

# 1.6 Identify the advantages of common design patterns (MVC and Observer)

- Design patterns are used to solve recurring problems seen in programming.

### Model, View, Controller

- Commonly seen in web applications.
- Separates how input from the user is handled and then presented.
- Advantage is that each component can be changed separately without affecting the others.

|             | Model                 | View                  | Controller                         |
| ----------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| What is it? | How data is organized | How data is presented | How logic is applied to data       |
| Example     | Database table        | HTML page             | Function that handles web requests |

### Observer

- A design pattern where a subject notifies a list of observers regarding state changes.
- Used in event-handling software.
- Advantage is that the observers can subscribe or unsubscribe as needed, there doesn't have to be a defined list.
- State changes may come at random, reduces need for observers to query the subject for updates.

# 1.7 Explain the advantages of version control

- Easily roll back changes. If a change in the code breaks something, roll back to the previous commit.
- Promotes collaboration. Remote repositories allow code bases to stay in sync between developers.
- Good DevOps practice. Commits to a repository can trigger other actions as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
- Helps with code review processes. Developers can see a diff of what will change to the main branch and provide feedback.
- Simplifies workflow. Create a branch and start working on a new idea immediately without worrying about messing up the code base.
- Another layer of documentation. Commit messages add context to why changes were made.

# 1.8 Utilize common version control operations with Git

## 1.8.a Clone

- Copy a remote repository to your local machine.

## 1.8.b Add/remove

- Add: add files to the index.
- Remove (rm): remove files from working tree and index.

```bash
# Add everything to the index.
$ git add *

# Adds everything in current folder to the index.
$ git add .

# Adds the file test.py to the index.
$ git add test.py

# Remove test.py from the index, but keep in the working directory.
$ git rm test.py --cached

# Remove test.py from the index and working directory.
$ git rm --cached test.py
```

## 1.8.c Commit

- Creates a snapshot of the index

```bash
# Open text editor for commit message.
$ git commit

# Inline commit message.
$ git commit -m 'Updated list of devices'

# Stage all indexed files and commit.
$ git commit -a -m 'fix: Bug #44455'
```

## 1.8.d Push / pull

- Push: push changes to the remote repo.
- Pull: pull down changes from the remote repo.

```bash
# Push changes to the remote master branch.
# If automatically tracked can be shorted to just git push.
$ git push origin master

# Push changes but also set upstream branch.
$ git push -u origin my-new-branch

# Pull down changes
$ git pull
```

## 1.8.e Branch

- A working tree based off of a specific commit.
- Useful for testing new features or if you don't want to mess up your master branch.
- A good practice is to create a new branch for every new feature/fix and then merge the changes in. Keeps master branch clean.

```bash
# Create a new branch.
$ git branch new-feature

# List branches.
$ git branch -a

# Switch branches
$ git checkout new-feature

# Create and switch to new branch.
$ git checkout -b new-feature
```

## 1.8.f Merge and handling conflicts

```bash
# Merge changes from the new-feature branch to current branch.
$ git merge new-feature

# Example of a merge conflict
# Above ==== shows what is in current branch.
# Below ==== shows what is in branch being merged in.
wow this is cool
<<<<<< HEAD
omg amazing
=======
so cool
>>>>>> new-feature
```

## 1.8.g diff

```bash
# Show differences between index and another branch/commit.

$ git diff b18ab6c
diff --git a/test.py b/test.py # what files are being compared?
index 1c211b3..91a9096 100644 # file hashes, file type
--- a/test.py # old file
+++ b/test.py # new file
@@ -1 +1,3 @@ # indicates a chunk. -1 means only line one is shown from file a. +1, 3 means 3 lines from line 1 of new file.
 wow this is cool # same on both files
+so cool # changed in new file
+another change # changed in new file

# Show changes in working directory.
$ git diff

# Show changes for staged files.
$ git diff --cached
```
